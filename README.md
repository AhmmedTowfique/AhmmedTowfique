# Hi, I'm Md Towfique Ahmmed 👋

DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and CI/CD automation across AWS and Azure.

I recently completed an intensive DevOps bootcamp where I built and deployed multi-tier applications from the ground up — progressing from EC2-based deployments to Kubernetes on both AWS EKS and Azure AKS. I'm now looking for my next opportunity as a DevOps Engineer.

## What I Work With

**Cloud:** AWS (EC2, EKS, VPC), Azure (AKS)
**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform
**Configuration Management:** Ansible
**Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker, Helm
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
**Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail
**Security:** Kubernetes Secrets, NetworkPolicies
**Networking:** Ingress Controllers, TLS, HAProxy, Bastion Hosts
