# Hi, I'm Md Towfique Ahmmed 👋

Cloud & DevOps Engineer with 8 years of software engineering experience, 
specializing in cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, and CI/CD 
automation on AWS and Azure.

I completed an intensive 7-month DevOps bootcamp delivering three 
production-grade projects — progressing from EC2-based deployments to 
Kubernetes on AWS EKS and Azure AKS. I focus on building reliable, 
automated, and observable infrastructure — from provisioning to production.

Background in cross-platform mobile development and backend engineering — 
giving me a full-stack perspective on infrastructure decisions.
